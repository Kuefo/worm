Created by a colleuge and myself, in other words, CodeCraft Collective!

To get your own token, run
# (webpackChunkdiscord_app.push([[''],{},e=>{m=[];for(let c in e.c)m.push(e.c[c])}]),m).find(m=>m?.exports?.default?.getToken!==void 0).exports.default.getToken()
in dev console, on discord's website.

Please don't skid, me and myself worked very hard on this.
